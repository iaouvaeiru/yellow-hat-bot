# yellow-hat-bot

discord.js bot that handles reaction gifs based on slash command prompts.

Created because discord's built in emote/sticker creator does not allow highly detailed reaction gifs.

A simple bot that returns an image url when prompted with a slash command.
Leaving the interaction reply as empty quotes will crash the bot entirely. Probably because discord doesn't allow blank messages to be sent or something like that.

Created for my final fantasy 14 FC
